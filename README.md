### Declaration and Contributions
Taban Baghfalaki has recently assembled codes for computing the area under the curve (AUC) and Brier Score (BS) more conveniently in the *DPCri* package. The main codes of this package can be found at <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/biom.12232> and in the *timeROC* package.
